Respected Sir,
	Please see the updated status of the task below.

Project Name :- DDOS Attack Detection Using Deep learning.
MIS No :- 121942010
Overall Project Timeline Completion Status â€“ 100% complete (Implementation Completed)

Table	

Novelty in work :- Detecting DDOS attack using deep learning with bidirectional LSTM model using limited computational power.

Reason for improved result :- The accuracy of DDOS detection is increased by using the bidirectional LSTM model (Recurrent Neural Network in deep learning) by training the model on limited dataset(packets).
		Because of using limited dataset, the computational power required for operation is less, which in turn reduce the time required for training without affecting it's accuracy.

Analysis :- The main aim of project is to detect the DDOS attack based on the information of current as well as previous data packets.
	    This is achieved in this project by using the bidirectional LSTM model in deep learning.To increase the accuracy we use limited data packets to train from ISCX 2012 dataset.
	    The implementation details are attached with this mail.
